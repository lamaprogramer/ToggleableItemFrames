### This mod gives you the ability to toggle the visibility of item frames!


To toggle item frame visibility, **sneak + right click with an empty hand.**

Alongside being able to toggle item frame visibility, **holding an item frame in your hand will make all hidden item frames visible.**

 

Installing this mod only on the **server lets you toggle item frame visibility.**

Installing this mod only on the **client lets you hold an item frame to see all hidden item frames.** If the server does not also have the mod installed, then all item frames will be invisible.

Installing it on **both gives you both features.**

 

If you come across any issues, post an issue on the github repo and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
